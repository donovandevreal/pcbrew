# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

No security updates are done, all versions will be listed on this GitHub repository, the PCBrew website, and the PCBrew page on WiiBrew.org and users will need to perform updates themselves.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

PCBrew takes security very seriously. As stated on the PCBrew legal and liscensing page (option 2 in the PCBrew app), the software is provided as-is with all faults. All data entered into the app is stored on your PC and your PC only, and downloads will only occur when you request them to. If this is a serious issue, make a bug report on the Issues page and I will look into it.
