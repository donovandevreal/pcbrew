## Reporting a Vulnerability

PCBrew takes security very seriously. As stated on the PCBrew legal and liscensing page (option 2 in the PCBrew app), the software is provided as-is with all faults. All data entered into the app is stored on your PC and your PC only, and downloads will only occur when you request them to. If this is a serious issue, make a bug report on the Issues page and I will look into it.
